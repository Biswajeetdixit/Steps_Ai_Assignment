# AI-Powered Resume Screening System

This project is an AI-powered resume screening tool built with Streamlit. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Groq API to analyze and score resumes based on a given job description. The system also integrates with n8n to automate actions after scoring, such as sending results to spreadsheets or notifying users.

## Features

- Upload multiple resumes (PDF or DOCX)
- Input a job description
- AI analyzes and calculates match score for each resume
- Automatically sends results to an n8n webhook for further processing
- Optional integration with Langflow for visually building LLM pipelines
